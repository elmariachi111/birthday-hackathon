### Last wise words 

if you want to go fast, use what you already know. If you start using something that's completely new to you, you'll lose quite some time on learning it. Which is good! That's actually why you're here - just make sure to go for the simplest goals you can think of.  

### contribute here :)

All this info is stored [in a public github repo](https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-meetup) and built upon pushes using Gatsby on Netlify. If you have something to add to the above list, go ahead, fork this repo and [extend the list](https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-meetup/blob/master/src/data/resources.md) :) No need to build anything locally, a change and a PR to the repo's markdown files will build your branch automatically and we can merge it soon. If you want to improve this website (for next year), feel free to use it as a Gatsby & Styled (Grommet) starting point :)

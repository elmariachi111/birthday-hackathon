if you want to go fast, use what you know. If you start using something that's completely new for you, go for the simplest goals you can imagine.  

### contribute here :)

All this info is stored [in a public github repo](https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-meetup) and built upon commit using Gatsby and Netlify. If you have something to add to the above list, go ahead, fork this repo and extend the list :) You don't have to build anything locally, a change and a PR to the repo's markdown files will build your branch automatically and we can merge it soon.

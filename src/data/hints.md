## Hints for hackers.

It might turn out to be helpful if you're following some best practices, hence we assembled some for you:

### Use the git.

We're quite sure that you've heard about git version control. Basically every project is based on it and it lets you collaborate on code easily. That's why you should setup a git repo for your team as soon as possible and make sure to onboard newbies if necessary.


### Good friends' APIs and docs

We all strive to be **good friends** at this hackathon. But some friends can be considered *particularly* good friends and we especially ask you to have a look at their APIs and offerings:

### Twilio

Twilio lets you build applications that communicate. Voice, SMS, chat at your fingertips:

- Twilio Quickstarts: https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart
- Twilio API reference: https://www.twilio.com/docs/api

Twilio's Developer Advocate Stefan Judis will give a short **overview of their APIs at 12pm** in the back room.

### Lisk

Lisk is an SDK for blockchains, anchored on a public decentralized ledger that they're running. If you know how to write Javascript, you can build decentralized apps on their stack:

- Getting Started: https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-sdk/getting-started.html
- Hello World: https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-sdk/tutorials/hello-world.html
- Run your own node: https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/index.html 

Lisk's advocates will also be on site that day and do a workshop and SDK **intro at 12:30pm**. 

### Mapbox

Mapbox lets you build beautiful maps, allowing you to style any aspect of them. If you've ever wanted an alternative for Google Maps, this might be the service you've been looking for:

- Mapbox GL JS: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/
- Mapbox Studio: https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/overview/
- Vector Tiles: https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/

Mapbox cannot dispatch someone to our hackathon but they come with a generous free tier and support us with good vibes.

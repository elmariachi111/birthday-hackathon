### Slack & Riot

<Imasch image="imgSlack" height="280px">

We've setup two communication endpoints for you. We think that *Slack* is really convenient for team communication and we invite you to [join our coding.earth workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/coding-earth/shared_invite/enQtOTU3ODMxNzgyODMyLWRlNjYwMWUwYjEyNzBiMDJiYTg0NTdmZWNjZGI5N2ZmN2M0MzhhYzMyMzMwOGUzNjMzZjNiYjcyNWZkMWUxNGM). Once arrived join the Slack channel **#birthday-hackathon**. Feel free to setup local team channels as well.

If you prefer higher privacy and want to checkout distributed messagin, we recommend *riot.im*, a messaging client built for the [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.org/). It's slightly less convenient but works without any central servers. [Here's our public riot.im room link](https://matrix.to/#/!mpdnualYWiXQAbsKQJ:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).

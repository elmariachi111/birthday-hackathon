### Slack & Riot

For the sake of event communication we've setup two endpoints for you. Slack is one of the most convenient tools for team communication, and we've setup a dedicated channel on our coding.earth Slack just for you. If you'd like to setup local team channels, you can use our workspace as well. [Follow this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/coding-earth/shared_invite/enQtOTU3ODMxNzgyODMyLWRlNjYwMWUwYjEyNzBiMDJiYTg0NTdmZWNjZGI5N2ZmN2M0MzhhYzMyMzMwOGUzNjMzZjNiYjcyNWZkMWUxNGM) to join the Slack workspace and join **#birthday-hackathon** upon arrival.

For all of you who prefer to live on the more private and distributed side of life, we absolutely can recommend riot.im, a messaging client that's based on the distributed Matrix protocol. It's sometimes less convenient but works without any central servers and comes with super high security. [Here's our public riot.im room link](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!mpdnualYWiXQAbsKQJ:matrix.org/$xM2ZYYwqs1z50VUSL7giZ59V17z8pT2_QGNxsnOAq6M?via=matrix.org).

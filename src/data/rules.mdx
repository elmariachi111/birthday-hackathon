## Rules, Perks, Good to know

Birthday Hackathon is supposed to be a **fun event**, no pressure, no judging, no concrete challenge goals. We're asking you to hack in teams and **present a 3 minute demo** of what you've built during the day at 10pm.

### Team Building

No one gets far when building things alone, so we strongly encourage you to work in **teams of at least 2 and at most 4 people**. Use the opportunity to find new friends and learn from them! We've reserved a ca. 45 minutes slot for **team building** in the morning.

During lunch time you'll find **sheets of paper** on the tables. Put your team's name on it, which challenge path(s) you're on and your own names next to it. 

#### Find a good hacking idea

We've put some hacking ideas on the [issues page of our website](https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-hackathon/issues).

<GithubIssues /> 

feel free to pick up any idea there and directly approach people to build teams around the idea. 

### Demo your hack at 10pm

Don't be shy, this is your chance to put your efforts on display. Entertain us, show what you've achieved, raise awareness of your idea. We're not going to record the demos and you won't believe how proud you'll be when leaving the stage ;) 

### Earn Help-Points to get an award!

This hackathon is **for the hackers** and not for the winners. But of cours there will be prizes we're giving away in the end! Instead of judging your results, we came up with a better idea:

Each participant receives **5 small sticker dots** when entering the venue. We refer to them as **help-points**. Every time you're stuck, **seek help** with your fellow hackers. Every time someone helps you out, stick one (or more) help-points on your helper's computer's bottom. 

After the demos we're giving away awards for the people who collected most help-points! If you want to go home with a nice "birthday" gift, make sure to **support as many people as possible**.

### üçêPear Programming

The best way to learn something new and become a productive team, is when four (or more) eyes look at code. On Saturday we're offering all **pear programmers** an appropriate fruit selection. Besides the vitamine intake it's a great opportunity to share some help-points, too ;)

### #Fussbook and footwear rules

<Imasch image="imgFeet" height="medium">

**Wild Code School is a no-shoes area** and we're kindly asking all attendees to obey their rules. Lets celebrate the attitude *Freeing your feet is like freeing your mind*: we ask you that any picture you share on social media that day contains a foot - your foot, our feet, your team members' feet - and use the hashtag **#fussbook**. You guessed right: "fu√ü" or "fuss" means "foot" in German. Good thing: you can't even possibly break GDPR with that :)

**Make double sure to wear socks üß¶  that look good on the internet ;)**

Bonus: you can accept this as a challenge and build a social media wall displaying all the foot pictures - Footage, to stick with the joke. [Here's that challenge's issue link](https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-hackathon/issues/9).

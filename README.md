## Rules, Perks, Good to know

Birthday Hackathon is supposed to be a **fun event**, no pressure, no judging, no challenge goals. The only things we're asking for: you should hack in teams and you should be able to do a **2 minute demo** of what you've built during the day at 10pm.

### Team Building

No one gets far when building things alone, so we strongly encourage you to work in **teams of at least 2 and at most 4 people**. Use the opportunity to find new friends and learn from them! We've reserved a ca. 45 minutes slot for **team building** in the morning.

During lunch time you'll find **sheets of paper** on the tables. Put your team's name on it and your own names next to it. Make sure we can read it at night. 

#### Find a good hacking idea

We've put some hacking ideas on the [issues page](https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-hackathon/issues) of this repo. Feel free to add your idea there and directly approach people to build teams around the idea. 

### Demo your hack at 10pm

Yep, that's mandatory. But don't be shy, this is your chance to put your efforts on display. **Entertain us, show what you've achieved, raise awareness of your idea.** We're not going to record these and you won't believe how proud you'll be when leaving the stage - even if your demo breaks ;) 

### Earn Help-Points to get an award!

We cannot mention it frequently enough but this hackathon is **for the hackers** and not for the winners. Which doesn't mean that there are no prizes we're giving away! Instead of judging your results, we came up with a better idea:

Each participant receives **5 small sticker dots** upon entering the venue that we refer to as **help-points**. Every time you're stuck on some issue, we encourage you to **seek help with your fellow hackers**. Every time someone helps you out, stick one (or more) of these dots on her computer's bottom. 

After the demos we're giving away awards for the people who collected most dots! So, if you want to go home with a nice "birthday" gift, make sure to **support as many people as possible**.

### Pear Programming

The best way to learn something new and become a productive team, is to watch code with four (or more) eyes. On Saturday we're reinterpreting that as **"pear" programming** and will offer an appropriate fruit selection for people doing so. Besides the vitamine intake it's a great opportunity to share some help-points, too ;)

### #Fussbook and footwear rules

Of course we could ask you to take pictures of our good friends' rollup banners, the nice Wild Code School coworking space, the cake (thank you [Lisk](https://lisk.io) for sponsoring!) or of your team members. Instead we want to resurrect an ancient idea of ours: lets take pictures that **contain at least one foot** - your foot, our feet, your team members' feet - and share them on social media channels using the hashtag **#fussbook** (you guessed right: "fu√ü" or "fuss" means "foot" in German). You even can't break GDPR rules doing so :) 

*Why... in the world... would you do that?!* Simple answer: **Wild Code School is a no-shoes area**. So, make double sure to **wear socks** that can be shown on the internet ;)

Bonus: you can extend this idea to a **team challenge** and build a smart **social media wall** that puts all the foot pictures on display. Footage, so to say. There's even a hack idea open for it: https://github.com/elmariachi111/birthday-hackathon/issues/9
